<p>Think of us as your general contractor for all of your marketing communications needs.</p>

<p>We’ll do some of the work (strategy, creative) ourselves, and coordinate other services for you – all the time ensuring that they fit into your overall strategy and budget.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing Plans</strong> – We help you identify your goals and your target audiences, and work with you to come up with an effective plan to meet your needs – and stay within your budget.</p>

<p><strong>Research</strong> – We’ll help you design and implement surveys and focus groups to get to know your customers better.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising</strong> – We can help you with concept, creative, production and media buying</p>

<p><strong>Logo/Corporate Identity</strong> – Need a logo? Need a NEW logo? Let us help your create a corporate identity that suits you – and your budget. We can also help you set up letterhead, business cards, envelopes, everything you need to make a good impression.</p>

<p><strong>Media Buying</strong> – A true art form. Our expert (a former sales rep) makes data-driven decisions and can usually negotiate a value-added schedule for you.</p>

<p><strong>Media Relations</strong> – We can help with news releases, new conferences setting up interviews, column placement and other contacts with the “free” media</p>
