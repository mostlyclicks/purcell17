<h2>Mike Blanchard</h2>
<p><strong>Vice President Administrative Services</strong><br />
Saint Joseph’s Hospital/Ministry Health Care – Marshfield, WI</p>

<p>I have known Ruth since she came to work for me in 1989. She is a bright, creative, talented woman and I have never had to second guess her work. As soon as she told me she was starting her own consulting business I knew she would be a good fit on a variety of challenging marketing projects at Ministry Health Care. We’ve used her to create marketing plans and help us introduce new services. Ruth has also coordinated focus group projects, and quantitative survey projects using outside survey firms. She has a keen analytical mind and can find a way to connect with anyone. We continue to work together on special projects, and I have recommended her services to others on a number of occasions. Ruth actually becomes part of your team and a member you can count on.</p>

<h2>Scott Chorski</h2>
<p><strong>General Manager</strong><br />
WKBT NewsChannel 8 – La Crosse, WI</p>
<p>WKBT-TV has worked with Ruth continuously since 2003. Our relationship started when one of our key clients (and her former employer) requested we hire her to coordinate an ongoing project with multiple dimensions. Some of the dimensions included a video component, scriptwriting, web content, and a special event. Ruth has always been thoughtful, innovative and creative. She’s such a pleasure to work with that we’ve invited her to do more with us. It has been a great partnership and we consider her to be part of our team.</p>
